### 🧮 Using RAG

BaseRAG provides an easy way to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation with various vector stores:

```python
from demogpt_agenthub.rag import BaseRAG
from demogpt_agenthub.llms import OpenAIChatModel

# Initialize RAG system
rag = BaseRAG(
    llm=OpenAIChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o-mini"), 
    vectorstore="chroma",  # Supports "chroma", "pinecone", "faiss"
    persistent_path="rag_chroma",  # Where to store the vector database
    index_name="rag_index",
    reset_vectorstore=True,  # Whether to reset existing vectorstore
    embedding_model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",  # Or use OpenAI models
    filter={"search_kwargs": {"score_threshold": 0.5}}
)

# Add documents
rag.add_files(["~/Downloads/Resume.pdf"])  # Supports PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON

# Query the RAG system
response = rag.run("What is the GitHub repo of the person?")
print(response)
```

**Example Output:**
```
Removing existing vectorstore at rag_chroma
The GitHub repository of the person is called DemoGPT, and it can be found at https://github.com/melih-unsal.
```

**Another Query Example:**
```python
rag.run("How many stars does the GitHub repo have?")
```

**Output:**
```
The GitHub repo has 1.8K stars.
```

These examples provide users with a clear understanding of:
1. What to expect when running these code blocks
2. The format of the output
3. How different agents and tools behave
4. How the reasoning process works in the ReactAgent
5. How RAG responds to questions

### 🔄 Combining RAG with Agents

You can also use RAG within agents to enable document-based reasoning. Here's an example:

```python
from demogpt_agenthub.tools import PythonTool
from demogpt_agenthub.llms import OpenAIChatModel
from demogpt_agenthub.agents import ReactAgent
from demogpt_agenthub.rag import BaseRAG

# Initialize RAG system
rag = BaseRAG(
    llm=OpenAIChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o-mini"), 
    vectorstore="chroma", 
    persistent_path="rag_chroma", 
    index_name="rag_index",
    reset_vectorstore=True,
    embedding_model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
    filter={"search_kwargs": {"score_threshold": 0.5}}
)

# Add your documents
rag.add_files(["~/Downloads/Melih_ÜNSAL_Resume.pdf"])

# Create an agent with RAG and other tools
python_tool = PythonTool()
agent = ReactAgent(
    tools=[python_tool, rag], 
    llm=OpenAIChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o-mini"), 
    verbose=True
)

# Use the agent with both RAG and other tools
query = "What is the square root of the number of stars of the github repo of Melih?"
print(agent.run(query))
```

**Example Output:**
```
Removing existing vectorstore at rag_chroma
Decision:
False
Reasoning:
To find the square root of the number of stars in Melih's GitHub repo, I first need to retrieve the current number of stars for that repository. After obtaining that number, I can compute its square root. The RAG tool will help me find out the number of stars, and then I'll use the Python Interpreter to calculate the square root.
Tool call:
RAG
Tool args:
{'query': 'number of stars in the GitHub repository of Melih'}
Tool result:
The GitHub repository of Melih ÜNSAL has 1.8K stars.
Decision:
False
Reasoning:
I need to calculate the square root of 1.8K stars, which is equivalent to 1800 stars. To perform this calculation, I will use the Python Interpreter tool to compute the square root.
Tool call:
Python Interpreter
Tool args:
{'code': 'import math\nresult = math.sqrt(1800)\nprint(result)'}
Tool result:
42.42640687119285

Decision:
True
Answer:
The square root of the number of stars in Melih's GitHub repository, which is 1.8K (or 1800 stars), is approximately 42.43.
```

This example demonstrates how an agent can:
1. Access document information through RAG
2. Use Python for calculations
3. Combine multiple tools to answer complex questions

The agent will:
1. Use RAG to find information about the GitHub repository stars
2. Use the Python tool to calculate the square root
3. Provide a comprehensive answer using both pieces of information

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to DemoGPT, a revolutionary open-source initiative that is reshaping the landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) based application development.

At the heart of DemoGPT, the capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo come to life, driving the automatic generation of LangChain code. This process is enriched with a sophisticated architecture that translates user instructions into interactive Streamlit applications.

### How DemoGPT Works

1. **Planning:** DemoGPT starts by generating a plan from the user's instruction.
2. **Task Creation:** It then creates specific tasks from the plan and instruction.
3. **Code Snippet Generation:** These tasks are transferred into code snippets.
4. **Final Code Assembly:** The code snippets are combined into a final code, resulting in an interactive Streamlit app.

The LangChain code, once generated, is not a mere endpoint but a transformative stage. It evolves into a user-friendly Streamlit application, adding an interactive dimension to the logic crafted. This metamorphosis embodies DemoGPT's commitment to user engagement and experience.

### Future Enhancements

We are planning to add a publicly available database that will accelerate the generation process by retrieving similar examples during the refining process. This innovation will further streamline the development workflow, making it more efficient and responsive.

### Model Flexibility

DemoGPT is designed to be adaptable, capable of using any LLM model that meets specific performance criteria in terms of code generation. This flexibility ensures that DemoGPT remains at the forefront of technology, embracing new advancements in LLM.

DemoGPT's iterative development process remains a cornerstone of its innovation. Each code segment undergoes individual testing, and the self-refining strategy ensures an efficient and error-minimized workflow. This fusion of meticulous testing and refinement is a testament to DemoGPT's pursuit of excellence.

By transcending traditional coding paradigms, DemoGPT is pioneering a new era in LLM-based applications. It's not just about code generation; it's about crafting intelligent, interactive, and inclusive solutions.

In summary, DemoGPT is more than a project; it's a visionary approach, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in LLM-based application development.

In the next release, we are gonna integrate **Gorilla** to DemoGPT to enable DemoGPT to use external APIs autonomously. The future is bright, and the journey has just begun. Join us in this exciting adventure!
