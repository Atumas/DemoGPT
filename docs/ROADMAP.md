# DemoGPT Development Roadmap

Our goal is to enable DemoGPT to accomplish anything that can be done through LangChain. In order to realize this goal, we have outlined the following development roadmap:

## Phase 1: Chain Creation

We will first enable DemoGPT to create chains. This will form the basic building blocks for the LangChain applications.

## Phase 2: Agent Creation

Next, we will allow DemoGPT to create agents, enhancing the system's interaction capabilities.

## Phase 3: API Usage

After establishing chain creation and agent creation, we will empower DemoGPT with API usage capabilities. This will allow it to interact with external services and broaden its operational scope.

## Phase 4: Utilizing the LangChain Documentation Tree

Here, we will enable DemoGPT to make use of the LangChain documentation tree, further enhancing its knowledge base and improving the quality of the applications it can create.

## Phase 5: Automatic Application Testing

Before moving on to application creation, we will introduce automatic application testing. This will ensure the applications DemoGPT creates are robust, error-free, and ready for deployment.

## Phase 6: Creation of React-Based Applications

In this phase, we will extend DemoGPT's capabilities to creating react-based applications. These applications will leverage a self-refining strategy, allowing for continuous improvement of the application performance.

## Phase 7: Automatic Deployment

In the final phase, we will append automatic deployment of the application for demo showcase. This will streamline the process of launching new applications, making it easier for users to get started with DemoGPT.

This roadmap will guide our development efforts, and we look forward to sharing our progress with the community as we work towards making DemoGPT an indispensable tool for LangChain development.
